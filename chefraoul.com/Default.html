            <h2>About Chef Raoul</h2>
            <p>Born and raised in the cultural melting pot of New Orleans, Chef was brought up to appreciate all the imaginative and classical cuisines that characterize his hometown. In the kitchen, alongside his mother and grandmother, he developed a passion for bringing people together through good food. His skills in math and science led him to earn multiple degrees in chemistry, becoming a chemical engineer and even working for NASA, where he got in trouble for fattening up a few astronauts with his homemade cakes. After exploring a few other professions, he decided to fully pursue his passion for cooking by apprenticing under a dear friend, Chef John. Now, as Executive Chef and Owner of Chef Raoul Catering, he is able to pursue his dream of mastering cuisines! French, Italian, Cajun, Barbecue, Mexican, even Indian food…no style of cooking is beyond his reach! His attention to details results in incredible food, as he never stops until every recipe is perfected, even if it means making dozens of test batches to get it just right (as his family will attest).  He does extensive research of every new cuisine, and has a passion for doing things the right way: the old fashioned way. His devotion to classical cooking is matched by his enthusiasm for classical décor, resulting in beautiful displays which bring an air of elegance to any event!</p>
